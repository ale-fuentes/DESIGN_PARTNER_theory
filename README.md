> This project I do for study about design patterns of projects.

## Introduction
Some tips that `Design Patterns` help us:

* standard solution
* abtraction of problem
* advantages/disadvantages

Existing many patterns how to [PEAA][link-PEAA-wkp], [EIP][link-EIP-wkp], and the group of four (and your simbol [GoF][link-GoF-wkp]), do make a book [`Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software`][link-GoF-amzn] where compilated 23 common problems and their best accepted soluciont

Ok, this project, where I study design patterns, I will do simple exercises to fix what I have learned. But remember, that only with exercises can we establish these good practices.

But, because is important that we use desing pattern?

Well :
* avoid bugs
* some methods with has similar function
* variables that don't the use
* if change rules business, can be a big problem.
* etc

### **Architectural Pattern vs Design Pattern**

One principal curiosity that somebody has is about if is similar  architectural with design. But this principal difference is do solution for macro to micro enviroment.

When talked about `architecture pattern`, we say the structural organization for software systems.

When talked about `design pattern`, we say how to solve reoccurring problems in software construction.

## Types of Patterns for GoF

* **Creational**<br/>
    <small>initialization and configuration of object</small>
* **Atructural**<br/>
    <small>going to separate to implementation fo interface</small>
* **Behavioral**<br/>
    <small>how to describe communication between different objects</small>


## Tools for to exercises

* UML
* POO
* One language of programation that support OO (I do use `Java`
)

## List Design Patterns

* [OOP](./Docs/README-oop.md)

**Creational**

* [Singleton](./Docs/README-singleton.md)
* [Factory Method](./Docs/README-factorymethod.md)
* [Abstract Factory](./Docs/README-abstractfactory.md)
